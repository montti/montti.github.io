title: Literally just an oatmeal cookie recipe
---

So it all started when I was a little boy... Just kidding, here's the recipe.  

## Ingredients 

For one oven-sized baking sheet of cookies:

- 150 g of unsalted butter (less if you like dryer cookies, 100 g for example)
- 200 ml of sugar
- 400 ml of flour without baking soda
- 400 ml of non-instant rolled oats
- 1/2 tbsp of baking powder 
- 1 tsp of salt
- 2 eggs
- 1 tbsp of vanilla essence (or more if you like vanilla a lot)

## Mixing & Baking

1. Mix the dry ingredients well, including the oats.
2. Cut the butter in small chunks and place them over the mix.
3. Crack the eggs and add the vanilla essence. 
4. Mix everything with your **hands** until homogenous, don't use an electric mixer.
5. Take little chunks of cookie dough and plop them on the baking sheet, press a little on the top so they are vaguely disk shaped. 
6. Bake at medium temp (I do not have a thermometer in my oven) and wait until the bottom of the cookies have a golden brown colour. 
7. Let them cool down, they taste better at room temperature.

Enjoy!
