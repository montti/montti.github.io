title: So... you need to download NetBeans 8.2 in $CURRENT_YEAR
---

Maybe your institution curriculum is outdated and using this version is mandatory or maybe there's some software environment that *just* doesn't work with anything else, or you just like old software.

## First things first

If you stumbled upon this page the official download links probably disappeared, again, but just in case please look around [NetBeans webpage](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html) or 
[Oracle's](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/).

The last working link was [this one](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-3413139-esa.html). I insist on getting your downloads from an official site because even if I'm swell guy, downloading random .exe and .sh from the internet is a Bad Ideaâ„¢.

If *that* didn't work...

## Archive Downloads

I took the liberty of putting all the installation files in 
[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2) and obviously didn't modify them but you just need to trust me (don't).

(The installation file is a co-bundle with the compatible Java version)

I REPEAT, USE ONLY IF THERE ISN'T AN ALTERNATIVE    

[Linux](https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-linux-x64.sh)

[MacOS](https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-macosx-x64.dmg)

[Windows](https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-windows-x64.exe)

And if you have a 32bit CPU from 2006 or something, first, bless your soul, second these are the links:

[Linux 32bit](https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-linux-i586.sh)

[Windows 32bit](https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-windows-i586.exe)

I hope that helped someone, cheers!
