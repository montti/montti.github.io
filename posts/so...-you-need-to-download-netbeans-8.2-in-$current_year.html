<p>Maybe your institution curriculum is outdated and using this version is mandatory or maybe there’s some software environment that <em>just</em> doesn’t work with anything else, or you just like old software.</p>
<h2 id="first-things-first">First things first</h2>
<p>If you stumbled upon this page the official download links probably disappeared, again, but just in case please look around <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html">NetBeans webpage</a> or <a href="https://www.oracle.com/downloads/">Oracle’s</a>. The last working link was <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-3413139-esa.html">this one</a>. I insist on getting your downloads from an official site because even if I’m swell guy, downloading random .exe and .sh from the internet is a Bad Idea™.</p>
<p>If <em>that</em> didn’t work…</p>
<h2 id="archive-downloads">Archive Downloads</h2>
<p>I took the liberty of putting all the installation files in <a href="https://archive.org/details/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2">archive.org</a> and obviously I didn’t modify them, you just need to trust me ;) (don’t)</p>
<p>(The installation file is a co-bundle with the compatible Java version)</p>
<p>I REPEAT, USE ONLY IF THERE ISN’T AN ALTERNATIVE</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-linux-x64.sh">Linux</a></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-macosx-x64.dmg">MacOS</a></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-windows-x64.exe">Windows</a></p>
<p>And if you have a 32bit CPU from 2006 or something, first, bless your soul, second these are the links:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-linux-i586.sh">Linux 32bit</a></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/download/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-windows-i586.exe">Windows 32bit</a></p>
<p>I hope that helped someone, cheers!</p>
